This is a historical document for the Twirp wire protocol "v6".
The new protocol was never released, all production systems use "v5".

## V6 is not going to be released

The proposal for v6 has been standing for too long without progress.
In retrospective, it was not a good idea to keep a promise for a
protocol update based on multiple features needing to be merged at
the same time.

Moving forward, Twirp will very unlikely update the protocol. There
are too many systems in production, using implementations in multiple
languages, using different versions of the library, generated by
different versions of the code generator, and with clients being
imported by other organizations.

## Intended v6 features:

When Twirp was first released in 2018, there was two major features
that required a protocol update:

### Streaming API

Issue: https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp/issues/70

Handle streams out of the box. Not implemented because
streams require assumptions about how the connection state is
managed, they are complex and not required by the majority of
Twirp users. Websockets or gRPC may be good alternatives.

### Removed /twirp prefix from HTTP routes

Issue: https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp/issues/55

Twirp routes have a `/twirp` prefix that is inconvenient in some
cases. There was a proposal to allow different route prefixes, but
too much time has passed since the proposal, and too many services
depend on this prefix. Instead of updating how Twirp works,
the proposed solution is to manage it from middleware.
