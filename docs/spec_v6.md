This is a historical document for the Twirp wire protocol "v6".
The new protocol was never released, all production systems use "v5".

## V6 is not going to be released

The proposal for v6 has been standing for too long without progress.
In retrospective, it was not a good idea to keep a promise for a
protocol update based on multiple features needing to be merged at
the same time.

Moving forward, Twirp will very unlikely update the protocol. There
are too many systems in production, using implementations in multiple
languages, using different versions of the library, generated by
different versions of the code generator, and with clients being
imported by other organizations.

## Intended v6 features:

When Twirp was first released in 2018, there was two major features
that required a protocol update:

### Streaming API

Issue: https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp/issues/70

Streams require assumptions about how connection state is
managed, they are complex and not required by the majority of
Twirp users. Because of that, Twirp decided to keep streams out
of the API. Websockets or gRPC are better alternatives for that.

### Removed /twirp prefix from HTTP routes

Issue: https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp/issues/55

Twirp routes were going to change remove the mandatory `/twirp`
prefix. The prefix was clearly not a good idea, but too much time
has passed since Twirp was released and now there are too many
services that depend on this prefix. Instead of updating how Twirp
works, the proposed solution is to manage it from middleware.
